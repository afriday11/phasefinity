# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

- Replace `tseslint.configs.recommended` to `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` or `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked`
- Optionally add `...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and update the config:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import react from 'eslint-plugin-react'

export default tseslint.config({
  // Set the react version
  settings: { react: { version: '18.3' } },
  plugins: {
    // Add the react plugin
    react,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended rules
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,
  },
})
```

Update notes for 12/12/2024

# **React Strict Mode Double-Firing Fix**

Fixed double-firing of events and debug logs that were making debugging confusing.

## **Root Cause: React Strict Mode**
- **Issue**: React Strict Mode intentionally double-invokes functions in development
- **Affected**: useEffect hooks, component renders, event handlers  
- **Result**: All debug logs and actions appeared twice in console

## **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Temporarily Disabled Strict Mode (main.tsx)**
- **Purpose**: Clean debugging experience during development
- **Note**: Should be re-enabled before production deployment
- **Result**: Single firing of all events and logs

### **2. Fixed Double Click Handler (GameBoard.tsx)**
- **Problem**: Both `onMouseDown` and `onMouseUp` called `onClick`
- **Fix**: Moved `onClick` to only fire on `mouseDown`
- **Benefit**: More responsive card selection, no duplicate actions

### **3. Enhanced Debug Logging**
- **Added**: Explanatory note about Strict Mode behavior
- **Improved**: Clearer console output for troubleshooting
- **Result**: Better developer experience when debugging

## **Testing Results Expected**
- ‚úÖ Single initialization log instead of double
- ‚úÖ Single card selection events instead of double  
- ‚úÖ Clean console output for easier debugging
- ‚úÖ Faster, more responsive card interactions

# **Game Button Functionality Debug & Fix**

Fixed critical issues preventing game buttons from working after state management refactor.

## **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Button Rendering Logic (GameControls.tsx)**
- **Problem**: Incorrect condition for showing "New Game" vs "Play Hand" buttons
- **Fix**: Now shows "New Game" when `handCards.length === 0` (no cards dealt yet)
- **Impact**: Players can now start the game properly by dealing initial hand

### **2. Debug Logging System** 
- **Added**: Comprehensive debug logging throughout game state flow
- **Components**: GameControls, Store initialization, GameSlice actions
- **Benefit**: Real-time visibility into state changes and button interactions
- **Console Output**: Emojis and clear labeling for easy debugging

### **3. Type Safety Fixes**
- **Fixed**: TypeScript errors in gameSlice for `boardPositions` type
- **Improved**: Explicit type casting for card positions
- **Result**: No more TypeScript compilation errors

## **Debugging Features Added**
- üöÄ Game initialization tracking
- üéÆ Button click logging  
- üéØ Action dispatch confirmation
- üÉè Card dealing verification
- üìä Real-time game state monitoring

## **Expected Game Flow**
1. **Initial Load**: Cards appear in deck (visible)
2. **"New Game" Button**: Deals 8 cards to player's hand
3. **Card Selection**: Click cards to select/deselect them
4. **"Play Hand"/"Discard"**: Process selected cards and draw new ones

# **Score System Implementation**

Added initial scoring system with proper separation of concerns. This lays the groundwork for implementing game rules and scoring logic.

## **New Files Added**

### **src/services/scoreService.ts**

- Pure TypeScript service for score calculations
- Handles hand evaluation and point calculations
- Isolated from React components for better testing
- Currently contains placeholder logic for hand evaluation

### **src/components/ScoreDisplay.tsx**

- New React component for score visualization
- Shows current score, high score, and last play details
- Highlights recent scoring events
- Styled to match existing game UI

### **Updates to src/App.tsx**

- Added separate score reducer alongside game reducer
- Integrated ScoreDisplay component
- Modified GameControls props to handle score dispatch
- Maintains separation between game state and score state

## **Architecture Decisions**

- Kept scoring logic separate from game mechanics
- Used TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Followed existing reducer pattern from the codebase
- Maintained single responsibility principle

# **Level Progression System Fix**

Fixed critical level progression issues where turns, discards, and level completion were not being tracked properly.

## **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Turn Tracking (GameControls.tsx)**
- **Problem**: `USE_TURN` action was never dispatched when playing cards
- **Fix**: Added dispatch of `USE_TURN` action in `handlePlayCards()` function
- **Result**: Turns now properly decrement each time a hand is played

### **2. Discard Tracking (GameControls.tsx)**
- **Problem**: `USE_DISCARD` action was never dispatched when discarding cards
- **Fix**: Added dispatch of `USE_DISCARD` action in `handleDiscardCards()` function with validation
- **Result**: Discards now properly decrement and are limited when none remain

### **3. Level Completion Logic (GameControls.tsx)**
- **Problem**: No logic to check if required score was reached and advance to next level
- **Fix**: Added level completion check using `checkLevelComplete()` from levelService
- **Result**: Game now automatically advances to next level when score target is met

### **4. Enhanced Level State Management (levelSlice.ts)**
- **Added**: Comprehensive logging for all level actions (USE_TURN, USE_DISCARD, NEXT_LEVEL)
- **Improved**: Error handling for level progression with graceful game completion
- **Result**: Better debugging visibility and robust level advancement system

### **5. Level Completion Reset System (GameControls.tsx)**
- **Problem**: When advancing to next level, old score and cards remained from previous level
- **Fix**: Added complete reset sequence when level is completed: score reset, board clear, deck shuffle, and new hand deal
- **Actions Dispatched**: `RESET_SCORE`, `RESET`, `SHUFFLE_DECK`, `DRAW_CARDS` (8 cards)
- **Result**: Each new level starts fresh with score at 0 and a new shuffled hand of 8 cards

### **6. High Card Hand Validation Fix (GameControls.tsx)**
- **Problem**: Multiple cards with no combinations were incorrectly blocked as "invalid hands"
- **Fix**: Removed validation that prevented playing multiple unrelated cards as high card hands
- **Result**: Players can now play any selection of cards, with multiple unrelated cards scoring as high card based on highest value
